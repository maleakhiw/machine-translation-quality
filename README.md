# Coursework NLP: Predicting Machine Translation Quality

**Author**: Maleakhi Wijaya & Faidon Mitzalis & Harry Coppock  

The aim of the coursework is to develop regression models to predict the quality of machine translated sentence from English to Chinese. The project explore 3 main embedding techniques: Word2Vec, GloVe, and BERT. In addition, we also explore various regressor models: Feed forward Neural Network, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, Random Forest, and SVR.  

The repository contains the following files:
- ```baseline_regressors.ipynb```: contains various statistical and neural regressor models and baseline word embeddings techniques using Word2Vec and GloVe with some modification.
- ```bert_regressors.ipynb```: contains state of the art neural regressor model and BERT word embedding technique.
